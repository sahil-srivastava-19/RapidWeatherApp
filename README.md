## Lessons Learned

The lesson learned while building this project is that you can noot rely on theories forever. If you really wanna learn things and make projects you have to start building them beacuse you are just a beginner untill and unless you have gain hands on experience on the topic.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was to find a reliable Api for the current observation of the weather of every city and place. Thankfully, Rapid Api's provides you what you need. there are a whole lot of api for every genre so check out on the website.

Apart from finding the api i also faced challennges in fetching the data from the api. There are other tools like Axios which could make your task of fetching the data easy as well as you can use async await too, but i wanted to master my technique using fetch so i used fetch technique.
